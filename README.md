Here are the different kinds of moves available:


R = Right side


U = Up side


L = Left side


D = Down side


F = Front side


B = Back side


M = Middle slice


E = Equator slice


S = Side slice


Everything is clockwise by default unless you hold shift while pressing it where that would be counterclockwise instead. In order to do wide moves, you would additionally have to hold control.
